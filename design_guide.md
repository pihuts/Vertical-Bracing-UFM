# Development and Testing Protocol
1.  **Isolate Testing:** When testing a feature, create temporary test files. Do not modify existing library files or shared code. All test-specific data, such as custom materials or configurations, must be defined within the test file itself to ensure tests are self-contained and do not have side effects.
2.  **Propose, Don't Impose:** If a modification to existing code is deemed necessary, present the proposed change as a suggestion. Include a clear description of the change, the reasoning behind it, and a summary of its pros and cons. No changes shall be implemented without explicit user approval.

Chapter 5
Design Examples
The design examples of this section are worked in a generally
complete manner and the design approach for each connec-
tion type is presented in the example. Design aid tables that
are currently printed in the AISC Steel Construction Manual
(AISC, 2011), hereafter referred to as the AISC Manual ,
have been used where possible. Examples 5.1 through 5.
address a corner bracing connection with the gusset plate
connected to the column flange (strong-axis bracing con-
nection). Examples 5.5 through 5.8 address a corner bracing

connection with the gusset plate connected to the column
web (weak-axis bracing connection). For each configuration,
four different uniform force method (UFM) procedures are
exemplified: general UFM, Special Case 1, Special Case 2,
and Special Case 3. Example 5.9 demonstrates the design of
a chevron bracing connection. Nonorthogonal bracing con-
nections, truss connections, and brace-to-column base plate
connections are addressed in Examples 5.10, 5.11 and 5.12,
respectively.
Example 5.1—Corner Connection-to-Column Flange: General Uniform Force Method

Given:

Design the corner bracing connection shown in Figure 5-1 given the listed members, geometry and loads. The bay width is 25 ft.
The connection designed in this problem is shown in Figure 5-1, in completed form (note that the final bolt type changes in the
course of the design example).

The required strengths of the brace connection were chosen to force many limit states to be critical. The required strength of the
brace-to-gusset connection is:

LRFD ASD
Pu = 840 kips Pa = 560 kips
The transfer force, as shown in the elevation in Figure 5-1, is:

LRFD ASD
Aub = 100 kips Aab = 66.7 kips
The beam shear end reaction is:

From AISC Manual Tables 2-4 and 2-5, the material properties are as follows:

ASTM A572 Grade 50
Fy = 50 ksi Fu = 65 ksi

Brace-to-Gusset Connection

The brace-to-gusset connection should be designed first so that a minimum required size of the gusset plate can be determined.
In order to facilitate the connection design, a sketch of the connection should be drawn to scale (Figure 5-2). From this sketch,
the important dimensions can be checked graphically (either manually or on a computer) at the same time as they are being cal-
culated analytically.

Determine required number of bolts

The preliminary design uses d-in.-diameter ASTM A325-X bolts. The calculations begin with the assumption that A325-X bolts
will work. However, calculations later in this example will show that the beam-to-column connection requires d-in.-diameter
ASTM A490-X bolts. It is not advisable to use different grade bolts of the same diameter, so ASTM A490-X bolts are used for
all d-in.-diameter bolts as shown in Figure 5-1. For now, proceed with ASTM A325-X bolts.

From the AISC Specification for Structural Steel Buildings (AISC, 2010c) , hereafter referred to as the AISC Specification, Sec-
tion J3.6, the available shear strength (in double shear) and available tensile strength are determined using Equation J3-1 and

From AISC Specification Section D2(a), use Equation D2-1 to determine the available tensile yielding strength of the double-

Check tensile rupture on the brace net section

Because the outstanding legs of the double angle are not connected to the brace, an effective net area of the double angle needs
to be determined. From AISC Specification Section D3 and Table D3.1, Case 2, the effective net area is:

Ae = AnU ( Spec. E q. D3 -1)

Alternatively, because Ae > 0.75 Ag , AISC Manual Table 5-8 could be used conservatively to determine the available tensile rup-
ture strength. The calculated values provide a more precise solution, however.

Check block shear rupture on the brace

The block shear rupture failure path is assumed as shown in Figure 5-2a. The available strength for the limit state of block shear
rupture is given in AISC Specification Section J4.3 as follows:

Rn = 0.60 Fu Anv + UbsFu Ant ≤ 0.60 Fy Agv + UbsFu Ant ( Spec. Eq. J4-5)
Shear yielding component:

Agv = 2(1.00 in.)[6(3.00 in.) + 1.50 in.]
= 39.0 in.^2
0.60 Fy Agv = 0.60(36ksi)(39.0 in.^2 )
= 842 kips
Shear rupture component:

Anv = 39.0 in.^2 − 6.5(2)(1.00 in.)(1.00 in.)
= 26.0 in.^2
0.60 Fu Anv = 0.60(58 ksi)(26.0 in.^2 )
= 905 kips
Tension rupture component:

Ubs = 1 from AISC Specification Section J4.3 because the bolts are uniformly loaded
Ant = 2(1.00 in.)[(3.00 in. + 2.00 in.) − 1.5(d in. + z in. + z in.)]
= 7.00 in.^2
UbsFu Ant = 1(58 ksi)(7.00 in.^2 )
= 406 kips
48 / VERTICAL BRACING CONNECTIONS—ANALYSIS AND DESIGN / AISC DESIGN GUIDE 29

The available strength for the limit state of block shear rupture is:

0.60 Fu Anv + UbsFu Ant = 905 kips + 406 kips
= 1,310 kips
0.60 Fy Agv + UbsFu Ant = 842 kips + 406 kips
= 1,250 kips
Because 1,310 kips > 1,250 kips, use Rn = 1,250 kips.

Check block shear rupture on the gusset plate

Assume that the gusset plate is 1 in. thick and verify the assumption later. The block shear rupture failure path is assumed as
shown in Figure 5-2b.

Shear yielding component:

Agv = 2(1.00 in.)(19.5 in.)

Shear rupture component:

= 26.0 in.^2
0.60 Fu Anv = 0.60(65 ksi)(26.0 in.^2 )
= 1,010 kips
Tension rupture component:

Ubs = 1 from AISC Specification Section J4.3 because the bolts are uniformly loaded
Ant = (1.00 in.)(3.00 in.) − 2(0.5)(1.00 in.)(1.00 in.)
= 2.00 in.^2
UbsFu Ant = 1(65 ksi)(2.00 in.^2 )
= 130 kips
The available strength for the limit state of block shear rupture is:

0.60 Fu Anv + UbsFuAnt = 1,010 kips + 130 kips
= 1,140 kips
0.60 FyAgv + UbsFuAnt = 1,170 kips + 130 kips
= 1,300 kips
Therefore, Rn = 1,140 kips.

From AISC Specification Section J4.3, the available block shear rupture strength is:

Check bolt bearing on the gusset plate

Bearing strength at bolt holes on the gusset plate will control over bearing strength at bolt holes on the brace because the brace
has two angles for every bolt hole; therefore, only the gusset plate will be checked here. Assume the gusset plate is 1 in. thick.
Standard size holes are used in the brace. From AISC Specification Table J3.3, for a d-in.-diameter bolt, dh = , in.

According to the User Note in AISC Specification Section J3.6, the strength of the bolt group is taken as the sum of the effective
strengths of the individual fasteners. The effective strength is the lesser of the fastener shear strength and the bearing strength.
Assuming that deformation at the bolt hole at service load is a design consideration, use AISC Specification Equation J3-6a for
the nominal bearing strength:

Rn = 1.2 lctFu ≤ 2.4 dtFu ( Spec. Eq. J3-6a)
For the inner bolts, the clear distance is:
lc = 3.00 in. − 1.0 dh
= 3.00 in. − 1.0(, in.)
= 2.06 in.
LRFD ASD
φ1.2 lctFu = 0.75(1.2)(2.06 in.)(1.00 in.)(65 ksi)
= 121 kips
φ2.4 dtFu = 0.75(2.4)(d in.)(1.00 in.)(65 ksi)
= 102 kips
Therefore, φ rn = 102 kips.

1.2 lctFu /Ω = 1.2(2.06 in.)(1.00 in.)(65 ksi)/2.
= 80.3 kips
2.4 dtFu /Ω = 2.4 (d in.)(1.00 in.)(65 ksi)/2.
= 68.3 kips
Therefore, rn /Ω = 68.3 kips.
Because the available bolt shear strength determined previously (61.3 kips for LRFD and 40.9 kips for ASD) is less than the
bearing strength, the limit state of bolt shear controls the strength of the inner bolts.

For the end bolts:
lc = 1.50 in. − 0.5 dh
= 1.50 in. − 0.5(, in.)
= 1.03 in.
LRFD ASD
φ1.2 lctFu = 0.75(1.2)(1.03 in.)(1.00 in.)(65 ksi)
= 60.3 kips
φ2.4 dtFu = 0.75(2.4)(d in.)(1.00 in.)(65 ksi)
= 102 kips
Therefore, φ rn = 60.3 kips.

1.2 lctFu /Ω = 1.2(1.03 in.)(1.00 in.)(65 ksi)/2.
= 40.2 kips
2.4 dtFu /Ω = 2.4 (d in.)(1.00 in.)(65 ksi)/2.
= 68.3 kips
Therefore, rn /Ω = 40.2 kips.
For the end bolts, the available bearing strength governs over the available bolt shear strength determined previously. To deter-
mine the available strength of the bolt group, sum the individual effective strengths for each bolt.

The total available strength of the bolt group is:

LRFD ASD
φ Rn = (2 bolts)(60.3 kips) + (12 bolts)(61.3 kips)
= 856 kips > 840 kips o.k.
Rn
Ω =
=>
(2 bolts)(40.2 kips) + (12 bolts)(40.9 kips)
571 560kips kips o.k.
Therefore, the 1-in.-thick gusset plate is o.k. Additional checks are required as follows.

Check the gusset plate for tensile yielding on the Whitmore section

From AISC Manual Part 9, the width of the Whitmore section is:
lw = 3.00 in. + 2(18.0 in.) tan 30°
= 23.8 in.

Approximately 4.70 in. of this length runs into the beam web, as shown in Figure 5-2, which is thinner than the gusset. AISC
Manual Part 9 states that the Whitmore section may spread across the joint between connected elements, which in this case
includes the beam web. Thus, the effective area of the Whitmore section is:
Aw = (23.8 in. − 4.70 in.)(1.00 in.) + (4.70 in.)(0.515 in.)
= 21.5 in.^2

From AISC Specification Section J4.1(a), the available tensile yielding strength of the gusset plate is:

Check the gusset plate for compression buckling on the Whitmore section

The available compressive strength of the gusset plate based on the limit state of flexural buckling is determined from AISC
Specification Section J4.4, using an effective length factor, K , of 0.50 as established by full scale tests on bracing connections
(Gross, 1990). Note that this K value requires the gusset to be supported on both edges. Alternatively, the effective length factor

for gusset buckling could be determined according to Dowswell (2006). In this case, because KL / r is found to be less than 25
assuming K = 0.50, the same conclusion, that buckling does not govern, will be reached using either method.

This completes the brace-to-gusset connection calculations and the gusset plate width and depth size can be determined as shown
in Figure 5-1. Squaring off the gusset on top shows that seven rows of bolts will fit.

Connection Interface Forces

Choose β = 12 in. Then, the constraint α − βtanθ = eb tanθ − ec from AISC Manual Part 13, with β = β, yields:
α = (10.7 in. + 12.0 in.)(1.08) − 7.00 in.
= 17.5 in.

This can also be done graphically as shown in Figure 5-2, with β = β = 12 in. Start at point a and construct a line through b to
intersect the brace line at c. From c , construct a line through point d until the top flange of the beam is intersected at point e.
The distance from point e to the face of the column flange is α. The points b , c and d , are known as the “control points” of the
uniform force method.

Arrange the horizontal edge of the gusset so that α = α and from Figure 5-1:

α= lh +win.+ tp
2
where tp is the yet to be determined end-plate thickness, w in. is the gusset corner clip thickness, and lh is the horizontal gusset
length.

Assume tp = 1 in. and solving for lh :
lh = 2(17.5 in.) − 2(1.00 in.) − w in.
= 32.3 in.

So, the tentative gusset plate size is 1 in. × 242 in. × 2 ft 8 4 in. The top edge of the gusset could be shaped as shown by the
broken line to reduce the excessive (but acceptable) edge distance. Proceeding with α = α = 17.5 in. and β = β = 12 in., there will
be no couples on any connection interface. This is the general case of the UFM.

Check gusset plate for shear yielding and tensile yielding along the beam flange

The available shear yielding strength of the gusset plate is determined from AISC Specification Equation J4-3, and the available
tensile yielding strength is determined from AISC Specification Equation J4-1, as follows:

Consider force interaction for gusset plate

It is usually suggested that the von Mises yield criterion be used for checking interaction; however, in its underlying theory the
von Mises criterion requires three stresses at a point and only two stresses (normal and shear) are available. A better choice of
interaction check is the equation derived from plasticity theory (Neal, 1977) and suggested by Astaneh-Asl (1998) as:

Therefore, the 1-in.-thick gusset plate is adequate.
Note that interaction of the forces at the gusset-to-beam interface is generally not a concern in gusset design, as can be seen from
this result. The AISC Specification and Manual generally do not require that this interaction be checked.

Design weld at gusset-to-beam flange connection

The forces involved are:

Vub = 269 kips and Vab = 179 kips
Hub = 440 kips and Hab = 293 kips
The UFM postulates uniform forces on each connection interface. For this to be possible, sufficient ductility must be present in
the system. As discussed in Section 1.2, most connection limit states have some ductility, or force redistribution can be accom-
plished either by support or element flexibility or by increasing the strength of nonductile elements to allow redistribution to
occur without premature local fracture. To allow for redistribution of stress in welded gusset connections, the weld is designed for
a stress of fpeak or 1.25 favg , as defined in the following. The 1.25 factor is the weld ductility factor discussed in the AISC Manual
Part 13 (Hewitt and Thornton, 2004), which is actually an overstrength factor, and is intended to allow redistribution to occur
before fracture of nonductile elements.

The required shear force and normal force per linear inch of weld on the gusset-to-beam flange interface are:

According to AISC Manual Part 13, because the gusset is directly welded to the beam, the weld is designed for the larger of the

From AISC Specification Table J2.4, the minimum fillet weld required is c in., which does not control in this case. Therefore,
use a two-sided v-in. fillet weld to connect the gusset plate to the beam.

Check beam web local yielding

The normal force is applied at 16.8 in. away from the beam end (assuming a w-in.-thick end plate), which is less than the beam
depth of 21.4 in. Therefore, use AISC Specification Equation J10-3 as follows:

LRFD ASD
φ Rn = φ Fywtw (2.5 k + lb )

Use an end-plate connection between the gusset plate and the column flange and the beam and the column flange, where the end
plate is continuous.

Design bolts at gusset-to-column connection

Use d-in.-diameter ASTM A325-X bolts in standard holes for preliminary analysis. If this bolt type proves to be insufficient,
use d-in.-diameter ASTM A490-X bolts with standard holes. Note that if A490 d-in.-diameter bolts are used for this part of the
connection, they should be used everywhere in this connection and on this job. It is not good practice to use different grades of
the same size bolts on a specific job.

For preliminary design, assume two rows, seven bolts per row, in the gusset-to-column portion of the connection.

A 1-in.-end-plate thickness, tp , has been assumed. The gage of the bolts is taken as 5 2 in., which is the standard gage for a
W14× 90 and will work with a 1-in.-thick gusset plate and assuming 2 -in. fillet welds. From Figure 5-4a, the clear distance from
the center of the bolt hole to the toe of the fillet is 1w in. From AISC Manual Table 7-15, the entering clearance for aligned d-in.-
diameter ASTM A325 and A490 bolts is d in. < 1 w in. The next step is to determine the fillet weld size of the end plate-to-gusset
plate connection to ensure that the 5 2 -in. gage will work.

The weld size is determined from AISC Manual Equation 8-2, including the increase in strength allowed by AISC Specification
Section J2.4 when the angle of loading is not along the weld longitudinal axis. In the following, only the weld length tributary to
the group of bolts is used; therefore, l = 7(3.0 in.) = 21.0 in.

Therefore, use a two-sided a-in. fillet weld at the gusset-to-end plate connection. Note that this exceeds the minimum size fillet
weld of c in. required by AISC Specification Table J2.4. Note that in the equation for Dreq’d , no ductility factor has been used.
This is because the flexibility of the end plate will allow nonuniform gusset edge forces to be redistributed. If the edge force is
high at one point, the flexible end plate will deform and shed load to less highly loaded locations. Since the required fillet weld
of a-in. is less than the assumed 2 -in. fillet weld in Figure 5-4a, the assumed 5 2 -in. gage can be used.

Check gusset plate tensile and shear yielding at the gusset-to-end-plate interface

Physically, note that tc is the plate thickness required to develop the bolt strength, B , with no prying action, i.e., q = 0. It is, there-
fore, the maximum effective plate thickness. A thicker plate would not increase the connection’s strength. From this we can see
that the 1-in.-thick end plate is unnecessarily thick. A thinner plate will allow some prying force to develop, resulting in double
curvature in the plate. Try a s-in.-thick end plate.

From AISC Manual Part 9, the available bolt tensile strength, including the effects of prying action, is:

Use a s-in.-thick end plate. Now that an end-plate thickness is known, check the end plate for the remaining limit states. Note
that the beam-to-column portion of the end-plate connection may require a thicker end plate.

AISC DESIGN GUIDE 29 / VERTICAL BRACING CONNECTIONS—ANALYSIS AND DESIGN / 65
Check bolt bearing at bolt holes on end plate

Check the bearing strength at the top bolts, assuming the optional cut on the gusset plate occurs and the end plate edge distance
correspondingly decreases to 1w in., as the available bearing strength will have the lowest value at that location. This edge dis-
tance is reflected in Figure 5-4b. The clear distance, based on this edge distance is:

lc = 1 w in. − 0.5(, in.)
= 1.28 in.
Assuming that deformation at the bolt hole is a design consideration, use AISC Specification Equation J3-6a for the nominal
bearing strength:

Rn = 1.2 lctFu ≤ 2.4 dtFu ( Spec. Eq. J3-6a)
The available strength is determined as follows:

LRFD ASD
φ1.2 lctFu = 0.75(1.2)(1.28 in.)(s in.)(65 ksi)
= 46.8 kips/bolt
φ2.4 dtFu = 0.75(2.4)(d in.)(s in.)(65 ksi)
= 64.0 kips/bolt
Therefore, φ rn = 46.8 kips/bolt
1.2 lctFu /Ω = 1.2(1.28 in.)(s in.)(65 ksi)/2.00
= 31.2 kips/bolt
2.4 dtFu /Ω = 2.4(d in.)(s in.)(65 ksi)/2.00
= 42.7 kips/bolt
Therefore, rn /Ω = 31.2 kips/bolt
Because 46.8 kips/bolt > 30.7 kips/bolt, LRFD (31.2 kips/bolt > 20.4 kips/bolt, ASD), bolt shear controls over bearing strength
at bolt holes, and this check will not govern.

Check block shear rupture of the end plate

The available strength for the limit state of block shear rupture is given in AISC Specification Section J4.3 as follows:

Rn = 0.60 Fu Anv + UbsFuAnt ≤ 0.60 Fy Agv + UbsFu Ant ( Spec. Eq. J4-5)
Shear yielding component:

Agv = (18.0 in. + 1 w in.)(s in.)
= 12.3 in.^2
0.60 Fy Agv = 0.60(50 ksi)(12.3 in.^2 )
= 369 kips
Shear rupture component:

Anv = 12.3 in.^2 − 6.5(, in. + z in.)(s in.)
= 8.24 in.^2
0.60 Fu Anv = 0.60(65 ksi)(8.24 in.^2 )
= 321 kips
Tension rupture component:

Ubs = 1 from AISC Specification Section J4.3 because the bolts are uniformly loaded
Ant = (^) [2.25 in. − 0.5(, in. + z in.)](s in.)
= 1.09 in.^2

UbsFuAnt = 1(65 ksi)(1.09 in.^2 )
= 70.9 kips
66 / VERTICAL BRACING CONNECTIONS—ANALYSIS AND DESIGN / AISC DESIGN GUIDE 29

The available strength for the limit state of block shear rupture is determined as follows:

0.60 FuAnv + UbsFuAnt = 321 kips + 70.9 kips
= 392 kips
0.60 FyAgv + UbsFuAnt = 369 kips + 70.9 kips
= 440 kips
Therefore, Rn = 392 kips.

Thus, this method is considerably less conservative than the “cut column” model.

Check bearing on column flange

Because tf = 0.710 in. > tp = s in., bolt bearing on the column flange will not control the design, by inspection.

Beam-to-Column Connection

This section addresses the design of the portion of the end plate that connects the beam to the column. The required shear strength
is equal to Vub (LRFD) or Vab (ASD), based on the brace force, plus the beam reaction from the Given section of 50 kips (LRFD)
or 33.3 kips (ASD). The Vub and Vab force is reversible as the brace force goes from tension to compression, but the gravity beam
shear always remains in the same direction. Therefore, Vub (or Vab ) and the reaction should always be added even if shown in
opposite directions as in Figure 5-3.

70 / VERTICAL BRACING CONNECTIONS—ANALYSIS AND DESIGN / AISC DESIGN GUIDE 29

The axial force in the beam shown in Figure 5-3 is affected by the transfer force, Aub, of 100 kips (LRFD) or Aab of 66.7 kips
(ASD). When the braces are in tension, the transfer force is compression as shown in Figure 5-1, and will increase the required
brace tensile strength of the next lower brace to:

LRFD ASD

47 2^976
kips kips

477
47 2^650
kips kips

Figure 5-3 shows that the axial force between the beam and column from equilibrium would be Aub + Huc for LRFD and Aab +
Hac for ASD, but it has been shown that frame action, as discussed in Section 4.2.6, will reduce the force Huc for LRFD or Hac
for ASD_._ Section 4.2.6 provides the following formula to estimate the moment in the beam due to the effect of the admissible
distortional forces from Tamboli (2010):

(4 -12)
This formula is valid for bracing arrangements such as those shown in Figure 2-1, i.e., those involving one beam and two col-
umns. Other arrangements would involve a different formula. For cantilever situations, gravity forces rather than lateral forces
will probably dominate and Aub + Huc for LRFD or Aab + Hac for ASD should be used.
As given, the required strength of the brace is :

If this value of HD is used, the axial force between the beam and column will be:

LRFD ASD
Hu = 176 kips − 55.9 kips + 100 kips
= 220 kips
Ha = 117 kips − 37.4 kips + 66.7 kips
= 146 kips
A recent study (Fortney and Thornton, 2014) has shown that the average ratio of ( Hc − Hd + A )/( Hc + A ) is about 70%, but
the standard deviation of about 0.33 was too large to make a recommendation for design. This study also shows that using
max ( Hc , A ) as the axial force may not be justified. This Design Guide will use the justifiable axial force of Hc − Hd + A for the
following calculations:

LRFD ASD
Required Shear Strength
Vu = Vub + Reaction
= 269 kips + 50 kips

= 220 kips

Va = Vab + Reaction
= 179 kips + 33.3 kips
= 212 kips

Ta = 117 kips − 37.3 kips + 66.7 kips
= 146 kips

Design bolts at beam-to-column connection

For the connection geometry, see Figure 5-1. Try (12) d-in.-diameter ASTM A325-X bolts in the end-plate connection of the
beam to the column.

As determined previously, the available shear strength of a d-in.-diameter ASTM A325-X bolt is 30.7 kips for LRFD and
20.4 kips for ASD. The required shear and tensile bolt strengths are:

Because A490-X bolts are required for the beam-to-column connection, they will be used everywhere in the connection. Using
A325 and A490 bolts of the same diameter in any one connection, or even within the same project, is not recommended.

Therefore, use a two-sided v-in. fillet weld to connect the beam web to the end plate. Note that this exceeds the minimum size
fillet weld of 4 in. required by AISC Specification Table J2.4.

The check indicates that the column flange is deficient. However, the effective length of the connection need not be limited to the
18 in. assumed. An increase of less than z in. per bolt, or slightly more than 4 in. total, in effective length is all that is required
to make the flange sufficient. This slight increase is okay by inspection. A yield-line analysis could be used to determine a better
estimate of the effective length.

Check bolt bearing at end plate

By the calculations for the gusset-to-column connection, bearing strength at the bolt holes in the beam-to-column connection
will not control. The calculations for the bearing strength at bolt holes at this location would be similar to those presented for the
gusset-to-column connection, except that the edge distance will be greater than the 1 4 in. used there.

Check block shear rupture on end plate

The available strength for the limit state of block shear rupture is given in AISC Specification Section J4.3 as follows:

Rn = 0.60 Fu Anv + UbsFu Ant ≤ 0.60 Fy Agv + Ubs Fu Ant ( Spec. Eq. J4-5)
The edge distance to the bottom of the end plate will be 21.4 in.− 18.0 in.+ 1.00 in. = 4.40 in., with a 1.00 in. bottom projection.
The controlling block shear failure path cuts through each line of bolts and then to the outer edge of the end plate on each side.

Shear yielding component:

Agv = (15.0 in. + 4.40 in.)(w in.)
= 14.6 in.^2
0.6 Fy Agv = 0.6(50 ksi)(14.6 in.^2 )
= 438 kips
Shear rupture component:

Anv = 14.6 in.^2 − 5.5(, in. + z in.)(w in.)
= 10.5 in.^2
0.6 FuAnv = 0.6(65 ksi)(10.5 in.^2 )
= 410 kips
Tension rupture component:

Ubs = 1 from AISC Specification Section J4.3 because the bolts are uniformly loaded
Ant = (w in.)[2.25 in. − 0.5(, in. + z in.)]
= 1.31 in.^2
UbsFuAnt = 1(65 ksi)(1.31 in.^2 )
= 85.2 kips
The available strength for the limit state of block shear rupture is determined as follows:

0.60 Fu Anv + UbsFuAnt = 410 kips + 85.2 kips
= 495 kips
0.60 Fy Agv + UbsFuAnt = 438 kips + 85.2 kips
= 523 kips
Therefore, Rn = 495 kips.

Discussion

A final comment on the end-plate thickness is in order. To calculate lh and α, tp = 1.00 in. was assumed. The final plate thickness
was tp = w in. This will cause α and α to be slightly different and will cause a very small couple to exist on the gusset-to-beam
interface. This couple can be ignored in the design of this connection.

The final completed design is shown in Figure 5-1. Note that no weld is specified for the flanges of the W21× 83 beam to the end
plate other than those out to approximately the k 1 dimension (the 1-in. returns). These welds are not required for the uniform
force transfer assumed in the calculations for the forces shown in Figure 5-3. If the flanges are fully welded to the end plate, the
bolts close to the flanges will see more load than those further away. This will affect the force distribution, which was assumed to
be supplied uniformly to the column flange as well, and column flange stiffeners may be required adjacent to these more highly
loaded bolts. It is important to recognize that a certain load path has been assumed by the use of the forces in Figure 5-3 and that
the connection parts have been developed from that assumed load path. Thus, it is important to arrange the connection to allow
the assumed load path to be realized.

If the flanges are welded to the end plate, this fact should be considered in the design from the outset. It sometimes happens
that a shop will weld the flanges to the end plate with AISC minimum fillet welds because it “looks better” and “more is better.”
But in this case, more may not be better. Fracture of the bolts and/or weld close to the flange may occur. However, if no column
stiffeners are provided adjacent to the beam flanges, the bolts near the flanges will probably not be overloaded because of column
flange flexibility.

The gusset “clip” of Figure 5-1 is used to separate the welds of the gusset to the beam and the gusset to the end plate. No weld
passes through this clip.
